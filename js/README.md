# JavaScript
This week we'll cover JavaScript (functional programming) and a bit of fundamentals of OOPs in Java too.

* [This]( https://javascript.info/) is a good resourse for JavaScript.

* [Here](https://medium.com/swlh/evolution-of-javascript-revolution-of-web-development-5df234a617e6) is the blog to know the origin of the language.

## Functional Programming
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-5obm1G_FY) video is a really nice intro for functional programming with JavaScript.
It was presented at JSConf by Anjana Vakil.
‚óè From through [this](https://github.com/sandeepb20/Functional-Light-JS) book on FP with JS we were to implement all the exercises.

I also implemented javascript to make my personal ***discord bot.*** Click [here](https://github.com/sandeepb20/6w6l_project/tree/main/js/discord-bot) for more details.
