Here are some python scripts for implementing [command line interfaces ,with argparse](https://realpython.com/command-line-interfaces-python-argparse/). 
### 1) [cat](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-cat-command/) 
The name of the cat command comes from its functionality to concatenate files. It can read, concatenate, and write file contents to the standard output.
* (i) [cat1.py](https://github.com/sandeepb20/6w6l_project/blob/main/python/cat1.py):This script will display the contents of the path file on the terminal.
* (ii) [cat2.py](https://github.com/sandeepb20/6w6l_project/blob/main/python/cat2.py):This will copy the contents of input file to output file. -a will append output file ,whereas -o will overwrite output file.
