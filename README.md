This is a summer project project on getting insights into various programming languages and understanding the different paradigms of programming.

*****************************
### *General Concepts*

This is a quick overview of ***Fundamentals of Programming Languages*** :

##### 1) Programming Paradigms
    Paradigm  is basically a method/approach to solve a problem using tools and techniques.There are lots for programming language that are known but all of them       need to follow some strategy when they are implemented and this methodology/strategy is paradigms.
   From a wider aspect, this includes the
    - ***Imperative paradigms***
    - ***Declarative paradigms ***

##### 2) Programming Models

Programming Model is a set of concepts used to create software, which are mainly used to guide the development of programming languages. <br>
The programming model acts as a bridge between algorithms and actual implementations. 
Languages can be classified into many, many models.
- ***Procedural Oriented*** :
- ***Purely Object Oriented*** :
- ***Purely Functional*** :
- ***Logic Programming*** :
##### 3) Type System

In programming languages, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to the various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions or modules.
- A. Strong vs Weak typing:
- B. Static vs Dynamic 1 typing:
- C. Manifest vs Inferred:
- D. Nominal vs Structural:
- E. Duck Typing:
